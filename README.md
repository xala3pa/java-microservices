# Java Microservices MOOC

Microservice applications take the concept of distributed system applications further by completely decoupling application services. Each microservice is a fully independent application, with well defined input and output that is exposed only through RESTful endpoints. The result is a system where any single service can be scaled, replaced, and linked to additional services, such as caching, without any architectural changes.

In this course you will learn to create RESTful Java microservice applications that can be deployed to Oracle Cloud Service. You will configure Oracle Developer Cloud Service to automatically build and deploy your application to Oracle Application Container Cloud Service.
